#  Dataset

We provide the fasta sequences used for training and testing of the HybPAS model. HybPAS aims at predicting poly(A) sequences (PAS) in human DNA genomic sequence. PAS fasta sequences  are located in folders "fasta_sequences/training_data" and "fasta_sequences/testing_data", respectively. Pseudo PAS and true PAS sequences contain 606 bp with the conserved poly(A) hexamer whose 5' end is located at position 301.

These data are compiled from the human genome hg38, located in GENCODE folder at EBI ftp server (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_28/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz). The associated GENCODE annotation can be found at  (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_28/gencode.v28.polyAs.gff3.gz).
